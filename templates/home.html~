	<p class="para"><span>Python</span> is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C.The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.</p>
	<p class="sub">Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.</p>
	<p class="sub">Like other dynamic languages, Python is often used as a scripting language, but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts. Using third-party tools, Python code can be packaged into standalone executable programs. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems.</p>
	<p class="sub">CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is free and open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its alternative implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.</p>
